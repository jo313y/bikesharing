It's important to know what time people are utilizing the bikes. The following shows the peak times, with the darker colors being a higher utilization. We can see that during normal cummuting times, the bikes are utilized the most. That is, between 6 am and 10 am, and a slightly higher use around 5 pm to 8 pm.

It is also shown that the utilization of the bikes is typically less than 6 minutes. Another graph was made that shows a map of utilization of the bikes themselves. The more they are utilized, typically the more they will need to be fixed.

## Analysis
We can see from the graphs that these bikes serve the community. They help commuters to and from work. We can also see there is a moderate amount of utilization on weekends. This means there is opportunity to grow. When bikes are used more often, they need to be repared more. We can see that the utilization is typically less than 6 minutes, which also means typically minimal repairs are necessary. 
It would be interesting to see how many bicycles are lost. In order to pull this data, we'd need to track bikes that have been decomissioned. We would also need to watch this data to see if any bikes stop being utilized at all. This would increase the overhead. It would also be nice to track the purpose for the bike use. This would be in the form of a quesionare, but the results could help push the sales force of the company.
